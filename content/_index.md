I'm a 👨‍💻 **senior software engineer** living in 🇩🇪 **Germany**. I love 💡 **learning**
new things, contributing to 👐 **open source** software, and using ✍️ **emacs**.

My current obsessions are learning **Rust** and **German**.

I lead the [da.gd](https://da.gd/) open source **URL shortener** project, and
throughout my career have been involved in the **Fedora Project** and
**Ansible**.
