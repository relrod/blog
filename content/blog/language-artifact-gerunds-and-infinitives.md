# Why I'm writing this

For those unaware, I graduated college with a dual major and a minor. The minor
was in linguistics, and the reasoning was simple: I really enjoy linguistics. I
think that language is so fascinating, especially historic, comparative
linguistics. Finding artifacts in our daily, modern languages that formed over
time. Learning how words changed over time, and how a lot of words we use today
ultimately can trace all the way back to
[Proto-Indo-European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language).
It's beyond fascinating to me and I can easily nerd out for hours thinking about
"weird" constructions in languages, looking up etymologies of words, phrases, or
idioms, or thinking about my own idiolect and comparing it to those around me.

In one of my linguistics courses in college (undergraduate), I had a really good
professor who assigned us a fascinating project. Every week, we had to write up
a few sentences/paragraphs on a "language artifact" that we found
interesting. It could be anything that we heard in day to day speech over that
week, or something we thought of or wondered about. It was pretty open.

I really loved this assignment, because I love thinking about such things. And
so I decided here to start doing something similar. I'm not setting out to try
to solve these "artifacts". Maybe in the future, I'll go back and revisit
some. But mostly, I just want to write up when I think of something interesting
about "language". I'm not restricting myself to English here, either. I'm
learning German, and that is fair game for artifacts too.

# Gerunds and Infinitives

So this is my first "language artifact" post, and it deals with the concept of
some verbs requiring a gerund while others require an infinitive (or a
to-infinitive), in English.

As an example, "I like **to read**." The verb *like* here can take a full
to-infinitive. But it can also take a gerund: "I like **reading**." -- this
works perfectly fine, too.

But what about "I want **to read**."? We _cannot_ just as well say \*"I want
**reading**." and achieve a similar meaning. It just doesn't work.

Okay, well, we can _like reading_ and we can _like to read_ and we can _want to
read_, but how do we discuss our _enjoyment_ of reading? The verb "enjoy" can
only take a gerund: "I enjoy **reading**." works, but _not_ \*"I enjoy **to
read**" -- that doesn't work.

So then, my open question, which I will not set out to solve here, is: Why is
this? What determines which verbs take a gerund or an infinitive or both?

That's for me to think about another day.
