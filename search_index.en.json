Entries"},"https://elrod.me/blog/ansible-fail-on-changes/":{"body":"First off, a note: Although at the time of writing this, I work on Ansible at\nRed Hat, this post is written in a completely unofficial capacity. It should not\nbe taken as official advice on how to use Ansible - only documenting a problem\nI had in my personal use of Ansible, and how I solved it.\nWith that out of the way...\nMotivation\nAnsible has long had a --check option to enable\ncheck mode\nwhich allows you to run a playbook without making changes (so long as the\nmodules you are using are written properly and respect check mode).\nThere's also a related --diff option, which, when combined with --check has\nthe effect of telling you \"what would have changed\" if you ran\nansible-playbook without --check.\nI have recently been playing with the awesome, open source\nSemaphore UI project, which provides a web UI and\nREST API over the main Ansible Core command-line tool. It is similar in spirit\nto the Ansible AWX project, except simpler,\nnot on indefinite release hiatus and\nresponsive to its community\n(cough). Oh, and\nyou can deploy it without Kubernetes - they ship RPMs, DEBs, Docker containers,\netc. Nifty.\nMy Goal\nWhat I want is this:\n\nI want to know about configuration drift on my servers\nI want to be alerted to it, if it happens, in the appropriate places\n(different places per project).\n\nThat's my goal.\nWhat I'm (not) given\nLet's talk about what Ansible and the third-party Semaphore UI tools both\nprovide to help achieve the goal - and also what they lack.\nGiven: Scheduled Template Runs\nSemaphore UI will let you\nschedule template\nruns. This is useful, because we can use this to run our playbook every day\n(for example), and see if anything changed.\nGiven: A (roundabout) way to run schedules specifically in check mode\nSchedules unfortunately can NOT be set to run a playbook in check mode through\nthe UI. But we can work around that, because the template configuration UI lets\nyou add flags to the ansible-playbook call, so we can easily just add\n--check (and --diff) ourselves:\n\nNOT given: Notification routing\nOne lacking area in Semaphore UI is notifications. The notifications\nsystem it comes with is very lackluster. Notification settings are largely put\nin a single config file, and every project and template uses those same\nsettings, so you can't readily say \"I want alerts from this project to go to\nthis Slack channel, and alerts from this other project to go to this other\nSlack channel,\" for example.\nI opened a discussion\nand within 12 hours the maintainer responded, saying he'd gladly take a patch\nthat revamps the notification system -- and this is something I'd love to try to\ntackle at some point, mostly as an excuse to learn Golang. But, anyway.\nSo, okay, not ideal. But we can kind of work around this... right?\nGiven: A REST API for task statuses\nSemaphore UI provides a REST API, with\nendpoints that can tell you about the status of tasks (playbook runs) within a\nproject.\nSo, theoretically, I could have some external system poll the API, check the\nlatest status of the right (scheduled) template which has --check in its\ncommand-line arguments, and alert if the last run failed. This could be GitHub\nActions, Nagios, Checkmk, Jenkins, any kind of tool where you can schedule\nperiodic checks and alert on them.\nBut that only works if the playbook run actually fails...\nNOT given: A built-in way to fail a playbook run if changes are detected\nWhile Ansible has --check built in, it doesn't have a way to say \"fail the\nplaybook run if any changes would be made,\" out of the box.\nHowever, it does have a plugin system, and we can make use of the concept of\ncallback plugins\nto help us accomplish this.\nCallback plugins allow us to respond to \"events\" during the lifecycle of a\nplaybook run in Ansible. Specifically, there is an event that gets triggered at\nthe end of a playbook run, that in the normal case, is what triggers the\nstats to display. And to display the status correctly, we must know if\nanything changed - so this seems like a great place to hook into.\nThe Plan\nSo, how can we accomplish the goal?\nWe can design a callback plugin that will exit with a non-zero exit code\n(indiciating failure) if any changes are detected.\nThen, we just:\n\nCreate a Semaphore template that runs our playbook and adds --check (and\noptionally --diff) to the command-line args, so they are always there.\nEnsure our playbook run makes use of our custom callback plugin.\nCreate a schedule to run this playbook template daily or as often as you wish.\nSet up some external tooling to ping the API and check the status of the last\nplaybook run with your template ID in your project and alert if the playbook\nrun failed.\n\nThe Callback Plugin\nThis is the plugin that I came up with. It's simple enough, just a few lines:\n\nBasically, what we do here is say, \"hey, send me events!\" and specifically, we\noverride the v2_playbook_on_stats() method which gets called at the end of\nthe playbook run.\nWe look for a specific extra_vars to be passed in (more on that in a second),\nand if it is, we simply look through all the changed status, and if any of\nthem are above 0, we sys.exit(3).\n\n    \n    \n        A note about sys.exit()\n        This sys.exit() call will do just that. It will exit. This means, there could\nbe other callbacks that don't get called before we exit, depending on the\norder in which the callback plugins run. In my case, this is fine, I am not\nusing any other callback plugins. But if you are, keep it in mind.\n\n    \n\nWhat I've done is created a plugins/callback directory in my Ansible project\ndirectory, and I've put this plugin there\n(plugins/callback/fail_on_changes.py). Then I've added this line to my\nansible.cfg also in the root of the Ansible project directory, in the\ndefaults section (create it - and the file - if they don't exist) to pick up\nthe new plugin:\n\nYou can test it by running your playbook like normal, but add an extra\n-e fail_on_changes to your ansible-playbook command. At the end, you should\neither see a red \"Changes detected\" (and the exit code should be 3), or you\nshould see a green \"No changes detected\" (and the exit code should be 0).\nMasking the behavior behind the -e fail_on_changes allows us to opt in to\nthe behavior and otherwise pretend it doesn't exist in the normal case.\nThe Semaphore Template\nUsing the deployment playbook for the da.gd server as an example, here's what my\nconfiguration drift template looks like in Semaphore. Particularly, note the\nCLI args section.\n\n    \n\nAnd here is the scheduler entry:\n\n    \n\nThe Semaphore REST API\nThere is documentation\non how to set up a token and access the Semaphore REST API.\nCreating a token became much easier in version 2.14, which (as of this writing)\nis in Beta. It provides a UI for creating tokens easily!\nOnce you have a token, you can use it to check the\n/api/project/PROJECT_ID/tasks/last endpoint, which will show the last 200\ntasks (template runs) for the given PROJECT_ID.\nYou can write a short script or use jq to parse the JSON, look for the\ntemplate_id with the template you made above, and check the status of it. The\nlatest run will always be the first in the list of tasks returned from the\nAPI.\nConclusion\nAnd that's really all there is to it. It's a bit of a roundabout way to keep\ntabs on configuration drift, but it works. I've tied it into my existing\nmonitoring systems, and have had no problems so far.\nUsing the callback plugin approach to return a failure exit code on changes is\nsomething that others might not have thought of, and I hadn't seen it done\nbefore, so I thought I would write up a short post here showing how it could be\ndone.\nGood luck, have fun, and happy automating!\n","description":"Detecting changes and configuration drift with Semaphore UI and Ansible.","id":"https://elrod.me/blog/ansible-fail-on-changes/","path":"/blog/ansible-fail-on-changes/","title":"Ansible: Fail When Changes Are Detected"},"https://elrod.me/blog/becoming-multilingual-rust-german-lingq/":{"body":"Background\nI enjoy learning new technologies and programming paradigms and languages. I\nalways have. And it's something that I've had less time to do over the past\nseveral years.\nIn 2020, I switched roles away from my position on the Fedora Infrastructure\nteam and into a more developer-oriented role on the Ansible team. When I did\nthat, something unfortunate that happened without me even realizing until much\nlater was that I committed less time to my side projects. You could almost say\nthat I burned out: I was writing code for work, so I felt less need to\nexperiment with it off the clock.\nIn practice, this had some unfortunate ramifications. Above all, it meant that I\nfell a bit behind on new languages and stacks that weren't used in my dayjob\nwork. And now it's my goal to back-fill some of that knowledge and experience.\nIn late 2023, I moved to Germany, and learning German has been a process for me,\never since. Before my move, I learned about the online reading platform\nLingQ and began using it rather extensively.\nWhat is LingQ?\nLingQ is a platform for language-learning that lets you import books, articles,\nand other kinds of media to read. It will track which words you've seen before,\nwhich words you know, and how well you know them (self-graded). As you come\nacross new words, it will show definitions that other users have added for that\nword, or allow you to look up the definition and add your own.\nAlthough it has its fair share of issues, outages, and downtimes, which I could\ntalk about at length, I've nevertheless found it the best platform for this sort\nof thing, and I have to give it credit: My German would not be where it is right\nnow, without having used it.\nAutomating Importing Content into LingQ\nMy first attempt\nSomewhere along the way, I developed a fairly extensive Python toolset for\nimporting content into LingQ. I never open-sourced it, for a number of reasons\n-- not the least of which, it was hacked together and never meant to become the\nmonster it became. The toolset handled a number of cases:\n\nFirst, I wanted to be able to import \"syndicated content\" automatically into\nLingQ. Things like podcasts, YouTube videos from creators that I enjoy, even\ndaily news articles from sites like Nachrichten\nLeicht.\nI also wanted to be able to import random articles or videos I found. (LingQ\nhas a browser extension for doing this; I wanted something more general that I\ncould use for local content, too).\n\nOver time, this Python toolset I built up became fairly heavy-handed. It did a\nlot. And over all, it worked well, but it be became harder to maintain. The\nusecases and scope grew over time.\nFor example: When you import audio content into LingQ, it can use AI to\ntranscribe the content to generate LingQ lessons. Pretty neat, and overall, it\nalmost works well, but it doesn't make any effort to split up the text into\nparagraphs based on who was speaking, which was something that annoyed me. So my\nPython toolchain grew the ability to send audio content to\nOpenAI's Whisper API,\ntake that response, feed it to a\ntext generation model\nto massage it a bit to make it more readable instead of just being a giant text\nblob, and upload that transcript instead.\nMost of the media downloading was ultimately powered by the amazing\nyt-dlp project. When you have a link to some\nmedia (be it YouTube, an mp3, or some video on some news side), there's a good\nchance that yt-dlp will know how to grab that media.\nThe Python code was fine. It ran in GitHub Actions for a long time,\non a\nschedule.\nBut because it grew in scope so much, it became hard to maintain, and it was\ntime to redesign it.\nSo. I had a new side project. And by now, I had realized and acknowledged that I\nneeded to learn some new tools and start branching out again instead of just\nfocusing on the dayjob stack. So?\nCut-to: Rust\nI made the decision to start learning the Rust language. Rust is extremely\ninteresting to me as someone who enjoys delving into type systems and\nprogramming language design. Rust solves entire classes of memory-related bugs\ndue to its type and lifetime systems. I believe it has a lot of really neat\nideas plus a very active community. I've tinkered with it before, but never to\nany serious degree, and it was time.\nUltimately, what I wanted first and foremost was a system that would let me\nspecify different \"media feeds\" and import the latest content from them into\nLingQ, in whatever way made sense for that specific feed. LingQ is broken into\nspecific \"courses\" each with an ID, so each feed will import \"lessons\" into a\nspecific course.\nLingQ has a page that will generate\nan account API key, but the API is largely undocumented. Understanding the API\ntook a fair bit of reverse engineering, which is perhaps best saved for another\npost. But suffice it to say, between examining what the site itself does when a\nlesson is created (by watching the browser inspector), and decompressing the\n\"official\" LingQ browser extension, I was able to understand the endpoints\nenough to do what I needed to do, which was just to import lessons and get a\nlist of existing lessons.\nHere's what I wanted at a high level:\n\n\n\n    &lt;strong&gt;⚠️ JavaScript is required to render the diagram.&lt;/strong&gt;\n\n\nFeed Processing\nWhat does processing each feed look like? Well, we know that we don't want to\nupload a lesson if we've already uploaded one. We could keep track of that state\nlocally somehow, but I wanted this thing to work in Github Actions (or any other\nkind of automation pipeline) and not have to worry about that. Besides, LingQ\nknows which lessons it has. So we can just ask it. We can get a list of lessons\n(episodes, in our case) in each course, and just compare the names. Sure, if an\nepisode gets renamed, it'll get uploaded again -- but in practice this is very\nrare.\nNow, for some sources, we can rely on the built-in LingQ transcription, as\nmentioned earlier. But for some, we want to run it through Whisper ourselves, so\nthat we can do some post-processing on it to clean it up a bit before we turn it\ninto a LingQ lesson. The feed processing ends up looking like this:\n\nQuery LingQ for existing lessons in the relevant course for the feed\nParse the latest N entries (episodes) from the feed\nCompare those N entries against the latest N lessons in the LingQ course\nIf we find a match, we're done, move to the next episode\nIf not, then we need to import a lesson:\n\nDownload the media (usually via yt-dlp, but other \"fetchers\" could be\nadded to the code and referenced in config)\n(Optionally) Send the audio to OpenAI to get a transcript\n\nPerhaps in the future, be able to run Whisper locally\n\n\n(If we did transcript in the last step) post-process the transcription to\nmake it look pretty\nTake the audio, and the transcript if we have one, and upload it as a\nlesson.\n\n\n\nWell, that's relatively easy enough for the common case. There are other cases\nthat this doesn't handle, that the Python code does already handle. For\nexample, the amazing Easy German Podcast publishes\ntranscripts for members -- and these transcripts are much better than anything\nWhisper can come up with; they are already pre-tagged with the speaker and\neverything! So being able to download the archive that includes those\ntranscripts and pull out the appropriate one is kind of an edge-case that would\nbe nice to have. Not necessary, but something the Python code does and that\nwould be good to port to the Rust version in the future.\nWhere lqcli stands right now\nAll of this is still very much a work in progress. The code is\non GitHub, but is not nearly complete yet. In\nfact, being one of my first ever Rust projects, it's quite messy, and I find\nmyself refactoring it each time I work on it. But this is part of the fun, for\nme, and most importantly, part of the learning process.\nLet's talk about what currently works.\nConfig file parsing\nIt will look for a config file in ~/.lqcli.toml where you can define your\nLingQ API key, your OpenAI API key, and your sources (feeds) for importing and\nmonitoring.\nHere's a brief view of what my config file looks like:\n\nThe first source I list (the awesome \"14 Minuten\"\npodcast for German learners) is a somewhat \"full\" example. The default\n(and indeed, only, at this point in time) download_method is yt-dlp so\nspecifying it is unnecessary, but it's there as an example. Similar for\ntranscript_via, the tool will transcribe media (using OpenAI) by default.\nThe tags feature is a feature that I added fairly early on - it does not exist\nin the Python version, and it's something I wanted. The main purpose is that I\nwant to be able to specify when certain feeds get checked. Let's say that I\nrun lqcli in automation every 6 hours. There is no point in checking a feed\nthat I know will only release content at most once per day. So having the\nfeeds tagged, means I can schedule how lqcli is run (in automation) and have\none automation that runs daily (passing --tags daily to only check those), and\nanother automation that runs every 6 hours (passing --tags 6hours or whatever\nI choose to call the tag).\nArgument and Subcommand Parsing\nUsing clap to parse subcommands and\narguments was downright fun. What a cool crate! It provides not only a\nbuilder-style DSL for creating command argument parsers, but also a way to\nsimply specify the command hierarchy as logical types (structs and enums) and\nderive traits and use macros to configure the behavior of the parser right\nin-line with the type definition. The doc comments become the help text for the\ncommands and flags.\nIn lqcli I opted for the derive method and my code ended up looking like this:\n\nThere is more to it than this, but this gives you an idea of how clap\nworks. The clap documentation (linked above) is amazing and they have plenty\nof examples in their source repository.\nUsing clap also gave us an awesome -h/--help system for free.\nChecking LingQ and Asking for Lessons\nThe next bit that already works is using the\nreqwest crate to query LingQ and ask\nfor a list of lessons in a given course (by using the course ID number).\nCreating a LingQ Lesson In a Course\nExtending on the above, it was easy enough to also add a method for creating a\nlesson in LingQ. I made a light abstraction over\nreqwest::Client\nso that we could create a client and store that in some struct instance and\nre-use it. It also handles things like setting up the required Authorization\nheader for authenticating to the LingQ API.\nGetting a Transcript from OpenAI Whisper and Tweaking It\nUsing async-openai, I am\nable to send audio data to OpenAI and get a transcript back in German. I am\nthen able to send it back to OpenAI and ask it to format it in a reasonable\nway.\nWith these bits alone, I was able to implement a few subcommands:\nlqcli transcribe\nThis is a command I added primarily to test the OpenAI transcription\nfunctionality, but have found it useful enough to leave it as a command. It\ntakes a URL to some media file, downloads it (using yt-dlp by default,\noverridable with an argument), then sends the downloaded audio data to OpenAI to\ntranscribe it and post-process it before dumping out the transcription to\nstandard out. It's basic, but it works. Currently, there's no way to override\nthe post-process prompt in this command.\nlqcli sources sync [-t TAG] (partially)\nThis command is what will actually do the work of importing episodes that need\nto be imported into LingQ. Right now, it is capable of telling you which\nepisodes need to be imported, but it doesn't actually do the full workflow\nyet. It's close, though. Filtering by tag (-t) does work.\nlqcli adhoc (partially)\nThis command imports an arbitrary piece of media at some URL, into LingQ. It\ndoesn't currently handle local media (this is planned) - it expects media to\ncome from a URL. You pass in the URL to the media, a title, the language code\nand the LingQ course ID, and it will do the rest: Download, transcribe,\npost-process the transcription, upload everything to LingQ. Optionally pass -s\nto skip transcription and let LingQ transcribe the content itself.\nThoughts and What I've Learned\nSo there is still some work to do to finish up this project. It's rather niche,\nso I'm not sure anyone other than me will find it useful, but it's been a great\nproject to learn Rust. I got hands on experience not only with Rust itself, but\nalso with some really popular and cool libraries, like clap and reqwest, and\nit's conducive to two of my current goals: learning Rust and learning German.\nThere are also some possible places to take this project to learn some more. For\nexample, we could make requests concurrently, getting to play more with Rust's\nasync/await functionality.\nBut for now, it gave me a cool project to use to start learning Rust. And I'm\nglad for that: I'm really, really enjoying Rust so far.\nI've learned quite a bit about Rust through this project, though it's really\nonly scratching the surface and I'm excited to learn much more. In addition to\nthe more uninteresting bits (like getting more familiar with the syntax of\nRust), I got to learn about borrowing and (indirectly) about lifetimes. I got to\nlearn about the different representations of strings (which I had learned about\nin the Rust book but, being a hands-on\nlearner, it didn't really click until I got to play with them first-hand.\nI got to learn about project structure in Rust, how modules work. I got to learn\nabout formatting and linting tools like rustfmt and clippy and about how to\nget a good development flow going for Rust in emacs. And of course, I got to\nlearn how much I still have to learn.\nLargely, I just got (ever slightly) more comfortable with Rust and its ecosystem\nand wrote some real code for a real project, because that's how I learn\nbest. And it was fun.\n","description":"Using Rust to automate the import of media into the language-learning platform LingQ.","id":"https://elrod.me/blog/becoming-multilingual-rust-german-lingq/","path":"/blog/becoming-multilingual-rust-german-lingq/","title":"Becoming multilingual in German and Rust"},"https://elrod.me/blog/language-artifact-gerunds-and-infinitives/":{"body":"Why I'm writing this\nFor those unaware, I graduated college with a dual major and a minor. The minor\nwas in linguistics, and the reasoning was simple: I really enjoy linguistics. I\nthink that language is so fascinating, especially historic, comparative\nlinguistics. Finding artifacts in our daily, modern languages that formed over\ntime. Learning how words changed over time, and how a lot of words we use today\nultimately can trace all the way back to\nProto-Indo-European.\nIt's beyond fascinating to me and I can easily nerd out for hours thinking about\n\"weird\" constructions in languages, looking up etymologies of words, phrases, or\nidioms, or thinking about my own idiolect and comparing it to those around me.\nIn one of my linguistics courses in college (undergraduate), I had a really good\nprofessor who assigned us a fascinating project. Every week, we had to write up\na few sentences/paragraphs on a \"language artifact\" that we found\ninteresting. It could be anything that we heard in day to day speech over that\nweek, or something we thought of or wondered about. It was pretty open.\nI really loved this assignment, because I love thinking about such things. And\nso I decided here to start doing something similar. I'm not setting out to try\nto solve these \"artifacts\". Maybe in the future, I'll go back and revisit\nsome. But mostly, I just want to write up when I think of something interesting\nabout \"language\". I'm not restricting myself to English here, either. I'm\nlearning German, and that is fair game for artifacts too.\nGerunds and Infinitives\nSo this is my first \"language artifact\" post, and it deals with the concept of\nsome verbs requiring a gerund while others require an infinitive (or a\nto-infinitive), in English.\nAs an example, \"I like to read.\" The verb like here can take a full\nto-infinitive. But it can also take a gerund: \"I like reading.\" -- this\nworks perfectly fine, too.\nBut what about \"I want to read.\"? We cannot just as well say *\"I want\nreading.\" and achieve a similar meaning. It just doesn't work.\nOkay, well, we can like reading and we can like to read and we can want to\nread, but how do we discuss our enjoyment of reading? The verb \"enjoy\" can\nonly take a gerund: \"I enjoy reading.\" works, but not *\"I enjoy to\nread\" -- that doesn't work.\nSo then, my open question, which I will not set out to solve here, is: Why is\nthis? What determines which verbs take a gerund or an infinitive or both?\nThat's for me to think about another day.\n","description":"I want [infinitive], but I enjoy [gerund]...","id":"https://elrod.me/blog/language-artifact-gerunds-and-infinitives/","path":"/blog/language-artifact-gerunds-and-infinitives/","title":"Language Artifact: Gerunds and Infinitives"},"https://elrod.me/blog/womier-rd75/":{"body":"\n    \n\nI have to be honest here. I got a new keyboard, and I like typing on it, so I\ndecided to type a blog post, because it gave me a reason to type and hear some\namazing thock1. I'm not a professional keyboard reviewer, and I'm still\nreally a mechanical keyboard newbie compared to, well, most anyone else who is\nin the hobby of mechanical keyboards. But I got a new keyboard, I wanted to use\nit and maybe brag about it a little, so I figured I'd write something. With that\nout of the way, here goes.\nI have always been \"kind of\" into mechanical keyboards. I remember back when I\nwas a kid, in my dad's office building, there was always a stack of IBM Model M\nkeyboards laying around. The clickiness of them was always appealing to me, even\nback then.\nThroughout my years as a developer, and even before then when I was in high\nschool, I normally used a mechanical keyboard as my main keyboard.\nI do have a problem of being indecisive sometimes, and this is a particularly\nbad problem to have with keyboards. There are so many choices to make when it\ncomes to what the \"ideal\" keyboard looks like for an individual person. Sure\nthere is \"mechanical or membrane?\" - but if we dig into the mechanical side of\nthat, there are many thousands of combinations of switches, keycaps, keyboard\nbodies, keyboard sizes, keyboard layouts, features, and colors to choose\nfrom. And these things all actually do make a difference in the experience.\nWithin the category of switches alone, there are linear switches (smooth),\ntactile switches (smooth but with a bump as you press them), clicky (similar to\nthe old IBM Model M's I mentioned above), magnetic, and some others. Then within\neach of these categories you have options like \"how far do I need to press the\nkey down to register a keypress?\" and \"how hard is it to press?\" and \"how loud\nis the keypress?\" - oh yeah, the sound is a big part of the appeal. That\nthock!\nYou can choose keycaps made out of a specific material, or with a specific\nprofile (do they dip in where you place you fingers or are they relatively\nflat?). You can choose a heavy, aluminum body for the keyboard (which has the\nbenefit of the keyboard doubling as a self-defense device) or plastic. You can\nchoose dull, muted colors that match any aesthetic, or vibrant colors that stand\nout. Or combine the colors with RGB for a light show while you work.\nThis is all to say, mechanical keyboards, in particular, come with a lot of\nchoices. This is, of course, amazing, because you have so much freedom to pick\nand choose what makes you happy. I mean, you're going to be presumably using\nthis device for a lot of hours during the day, so you want something you enjoy\nusing (or just collecting it - also a fine option, but you still want something\nenjoyable to look at in that case).\nWhile I am aware of all of these options, I only kept a foot in the door in the\nhobby of mechanical keyboards. In fact, I still have yet to build a custom\nboard. But I've had a number of mechanical keyboards in my life, from Model\nM's, to a Das Keyboard, to Filco boards, a Ducky One 3, an 8bitdo Retro\nKeyboard, and some others.\nUp until a few days ago, my latest board has been the\n8bitdo Retro Keyboard. It's\na neat looking keyboard, designed to look like either an old Xbox, Saturn, NES,\nCommodore 64, Famicom, or a slightly modernized Model M -- depending on which\nstyle you pick. It comes with\nKailh Box White V2\nswitches, which are clicky, much like Model M switches are.\nBut I made a dangerous decision a few days ago: I decided it was time to treat\nmyself to a new keyboard. Why is this decision dangerous? Because it's one step\ncloser to truly getting into mechanical keyboards as a hobby, meaning I start\ncollecting switches and keycap sets, and start customizing or modding or\nbuilding my own keyboards. And in addition to being very time-consuming, it can\nbe a rather expensive hobby, as you can determine by just looking around a\nbit. Premium switches can sometimes cost more than $1 USD per switch, so for a\nfull 108 key set, you're over $100 USD just to try out a new kind of switch2.\nYes, there are switch tester boards that you can get relatively inexpensively,\nbut I think they can't really give you a sense for how the switch will really\nfeel once it's in the PCB in the keyboard case with a particular set of keycaps\non it. The sound dynamics alone are completely different depending on all these\nfactors, and there's just no real way to replicate that on a tester board.\nSo anyway, I had to decide on a new keyboard. I didn't want to break the bank,\nbut I wanted something different. I wanted something that sounded good, felt\ngood, and looked good.\nI recently ordered a set of\nMT3 keycaps\nand I actually installed them on my 8bitdo board and was happy with how they\nfelt (the profile on them is unlike any other keycap I've used before; it really\ncups to your fingers). I just needed a new board. And I didn't particularly want\nto do a from-scratch build, because that still kind of scares me. Basically, I\nwanted a modifiable board that sounds good, lets me use my MT3 keycaps, and is\n\"different\".\nBy \"different\", I decided on linear switches, mostly because despite all the\nmechanical keyboards I've had in my life, I've actually never had a keyboard\nwith linear switches; they've all been tactile or clicky -- mostly clicky.\nIn searching around, I found a few budget options that looked decent. I searched\nout some YouTube and Reddit reviews, listened to a few sound tests, and\nultimately decided on a\nWomier RD75 Pro. (Note:\nThis post is not sponsored in any way.)\nTwo days after ordering, it had arrived at my local PackStation, and I picked it\nup. My first impression was, \"wow this box is heavy\". I unboxed it -- literally\nin my car, because I was so excited to see it -- and was completely blown\naway. It was my first ever aluminum-bodied mechanical keyboard, and it felt\nso premium compared to all of my previous mechnical keyboards. And the\nsound. The THOCK. OH MY GOD.\nThis was three days ago. The amusing thing is, though, that I like how it looks\nand feels so much, that I have yet to install my MT3 keycaps on it. I'm running\nit with the stock keycaps (I have the blue variant), because the keycaps\nactually feel really good to me, and color-wise, to me, they look beautiful. I'm\nplanning on another keyboard for the MT3s now, because I am redoing my working\nspace/office, and will have another workstation set up and will ultimately need\na new keyboard for that area, too. I will likely do another post on that too. It\nwill likely be a bit more custom, but not a fully from-scratch build.\nThe RD75 board (in the blue variant) comes with\nWomier's\nfull POM grey linear\nswitches, which feel absolutely amazing to me (granted, they are my first linear\nswitch, so I am not much of a judge here). They feel snappy and springy, they\nsound amazing in the aluminum body of the keyboard, and in general I am\nextremely happy with them.\nThis board is also my first 75% keyboard. Up until now, I had largely\nstandardized on TKL (tenkeyless, i.e. a full size keyboard minus the number\npad, which I rarely used). Going from TKL to 75% isn't that\ndifferent. Effectively, the arrow keys are moved closer to the rest of the keys,\nand you lose \"print screen\", \"scroll lock\", and \"pause break\". Depending on\nmodel, as in the RD75, you might also lose the insert key. But that's it. If you\ngo down to 65% or 60%, you lose the f-keys (which I don't care about too much)\nand also having a separate \"escape\" and \"tilde/backtick\" key. They merge into a\nsingle \"escape\" key that sits next to the \"1\" key. And that I do care about.\nIf keyboard sizes like this are new to you, \"Keyboard University\" has a good\nguide\navailable.\nI really want to go down to 60%, mostly because I think they look nice, and I\ndon't lose much by not having \"delete\", \"home\", \"end\". You see, I use\nemacs-style keybindings on MacOS, which it supports out of the box. I never use\nthe \"home\" key to go to the start of the line, I just press control-a. Similar\nfor \"end\" (control-e), and \"delete\" (control-d). In fact, same for the arrow\nkeys, for \"down\" I use control-n, \"up\" control-p, \"left\" control-b, \"right\"\ncontrol-f. These are standard on MacOS and within emacs -- the two operating\nsystems I care most about ;) so losing these keys wouldn't be a huge deal. \"Page\nup\" and \"page down\" could be a bit annoying, simply because by default MacOS\ndoesn't provide the emacs equivalents for those, though you can work around\nthat and I don't use them enough to care too much. I would be fine with those\nliving on a separate function layer or something3. Anyway, enough on that.\nI did have one small issue, where one key (;) would sometimes double-register,\nparticularly when I struck it in a certain way. Luckily, Womier includes some\nspare switches in the box, so I ripped off the keycap with a keycap remover (you\ntend to collect those if you buy a few mechnical keyboards), pulled out the\nswitch, and replaced it with one of the spares. I marked the old one and kept it\nwith the spares, just for future emergency use (it does work, it's just slightly\nannoying with the occasional double registering). After that, the problem went\naway, and I have been happy since. I'm typing this very post on the RD75.\nThere's a lot I haven't touched on here. There are a fair number of RGB options\nbuilt in, changeable with the fn key. Of course, the keyboard is programmable,\ntoo, with QMK/VIA, though I haven't delved into that at all, yet. I presume the\nRGB is also configurable through that.\nSo to end things: I now love linear switches. I still want to try other kinds of\nswitches, because there are tons and tons out there and I've really only\nexperienced a few. I particularly want to try more tactile switches. The Ducky\nboard I had came with MX Clears, which are tactile, but are definitely not my\nfavorite. I think that other kinds of tactiles have a different feel and I want\nto give some of them a fair shot. But I think going forward, my heart will\nalways go back to linears, because these just feel amazing to type on.\nI am a little too happy with the RD75: I fully had planned to replace the\nkeycaps, as mentioned above, but I just can't bring myself to do it. The stock\nones are just fun to type on. So, there it is.\n1\nFor those not \"in the know\" - thock is the deep sound some keyboards\nmake when you press the buttons on them. It is distinct from clack\nwhich tends to be higher in frequency than thock.\n\n2\nLuckily, switches nowadays are mostly hot-swappable, so you at least don't\nhave to buy a whole new keyboard body or build a new keyboard to try out a\nnew set of switches.\n\n3\nThe bigger problem with 60% for me is the lack of a dedicated\ntilde/backtick button, as mentioned above. I live in emacs and the\nterminal, where I am constantly writing code and commands that require\nthese symbols. Having to shift to a secondary \"row\" to use them wouldn't\nwork well for me. I know that people say you get used to it, but I truly\nthink I rely on these keys enough that it would be annoying to have to\npress another key to type a backtick. (Usually in 60% boards, \"escape\" is\nnext to the \"1\" key, and shift-escape will still give you a tilde, so the\nmissing character is really just the backtick). I have more thoughts about\nthis, that I will save for another post.\n\n","description":"I recently picked up a Womier RD75 Pro mechanical keyboard; here are my thoughts.","id":"https://elrod.me/blog/womier-rd75/","path":"/blog/womier-rd75/","title":"Womier RD75 Pro: A quick review"},"https://elrod.me/projects/":{"body":"","description":"","id":"https://elrod.me/projects/","path":"/projects/","title":"Projects"},"https://elrod.me/projects/dagd/":{"body":"","description":"An open-source, medium-traffic **URL shortener** service, hosting **~40mil** URLs and servicing **~264k** requests daily.","id":"https://elrod.me/projects/dagd/","path":"/projects/dagd/","title":"da.gd"},"https://elrod.me/projects/lqcli/":{"body":"","description":"A command-line tool in **Rust** for automating imports into the LingQ language-learning platform.","id":"https://elrod.me/projects/lqcli/","path":"/projects/lqcli/","title":"lqcli"},"https://elrod.me/projects/zeeb/":{"body":"","description":"A small **word game** built in **Rust** using the **Bevy** engine.","id":"https://elrod.me/projects/zeeb/","path":"/projects/zeeb/","title":"Zeeb"}},"docInfo":{"https://elrod.me/":{"body":36,"description":0,"path":0,"title":3},"https://elrod.me/archive/":{"body":0,"description":0,"path":1,"title":1},"https://elrod.me/blog/":{"body":0,"description":0,"path":1,"title":2},"https://elrod.me/blog/ansible-fail-on-changes/":{"body":702,"description":7,"path":4,"title":4},"https://elrod.me/blog/becoming-multilingual-rust-german-lingq/":{"body":1300,"description":9,"path":6,"title":4},"https://elrod.me/blog/language-artifact-gerunds-and-infinitives/":{"body":220,"description":4,"path":5,"title":4},"https://elrod.me/blog/womier-rd75/":{"body":1079,"description":10,"path":3,"title":5},"https://elrod.me/projects/":{"body":0,"description":0,"path":1,"title":1},"https://elrod.me/projects/dagd/":{"body":0,"description":14,"path":2,"title":1},"https://elrod.me/projects/lqcli/":{"body":0,"description":10,"path":2,"title":1},"https://elrod.me/projects/zeeb/":{"body":0,"description":8,"path":2,"title":1}},"length":11},"lang":"English"}
